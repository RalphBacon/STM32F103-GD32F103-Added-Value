#### *Does the GD32F103 ARM Cortex M3 licenced processor add value to the Original Blue Pill?*

In conjunction with my sponsor, lcsc.com, we thought it would be interesting to compare international brands (such as STMicroelectronics, an international manufacturer) to predominantly Chinese market suppliers (such as GigaDevice, an authorised Asian manufacturer).

So I'm comparing here the STM32F103 and the GD32F103 and discover whether they are, first and foremost, compatible, and secondly what added value the GigaDevice device might give developers (hint: see the video's benchmark comparison table!)

And, a bit of a surprise for me, my "Blue Pill" STM32F103s were not original either! Another Chinese manufacturer was being used, CKS, although trying to find out anything about this company is very difficult (and it's all in Chinese).

But there's a lot to consider in this video, and let's not forget the new, improved Prime Number sketch that gives a better, level playing field for all microControllers.
